#Introduction - CSE114

	CSE114 will be taught conceptually so you will learn the foundations to code in ANY language!

#Computers and machines conceptualized

	So in this section we will be looking at the nature of computers. The nature of a computer acts and behaves the way a human tells it to. In order to use our vaccum cleaner or use our computer we do not need to know how it's hardware or components. What we do need to know is how the device we are using, functions and how to make it do what we need it to do.

		Example:

lets say I have an radio from the early 90s. Lets say that I want to listen to some tunes on the radio, What would I need to know to make it do what I want it to do? Would I need to know how the device recieves electromagnetic waves? Do I need knowledge about electric circuitry? Probably not right? What I really need to understand is how to turn a knob and push a button to listen to the device. These instructions probably come with your device when you buy it. 

#Algorithms
	So you must be thinking to yourself, algorithms? Isn't this a programming course? This is exactly what that is. believe it or not, photoshop, app or the web browser you are using are created by a set of instructions which are also called algorithms. Programming isn't about knowing how to code in Java or code in some language. Programming is about thinking about problems and solving them with algorithms. 


	For example: 
So you don't know
